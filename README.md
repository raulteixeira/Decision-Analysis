Scientific Initiation developed on decision analysis topic, from august 2018 to july 2019.

In this undergraduate research, I initialized the studies of Decision Analysis and Value of Information (VoI), then applied my acquired knowledge to a simple problem at geophysics field.

With this research, I could initiate my scientific career and learn how to develop and carry a research, and also refine my knowledge about decision making.
